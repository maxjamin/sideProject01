# sideProject01

This project consists of a raspberry pie and a android phone application. The simple phone application authenticates with a server running express node js, then allows the phone user to turn on and record a camera installed on a raspberry pie through bluetooth. The application also allows the user to stop and start at various times and upload their files to a server.
